# Scientific Method Research
The Scientific Method that I am using is the Learning Pyramid, which consists of 7 components. They are listed below in ascending order of retention of information and have been explained as well.

## Lecture (5% Retention) – 
Although the retention is the least, this is the most common way to teach students. This medium is also the most passive as there is no active participation from the students.

## Reading (10% Retention) – 
Reading is thought to be a somewhat more successful learning method than other methods, even though it is still passive, because it allows students to mark important learning parts and frequently come back to the content as a reference.

## Audio-visual (20% Retention) – 
This kind of learning is becoming more and more popular as digital technology and learning expand. It is thought to be more effective since it includes additional learning components, even though it is still classified as passive learning. Even though visual aids like pictures, handouts, flipcharts, slide shows, projections, and videos are thought to improve learning retention, lectures still take place most of the time.

## Demonstration (30% Retention) – 
According to The Learning Pyramid, demonstration is the first active learning strategy. Put simply, it refers to a teacher demonstrating something to a pupil in a step-by-step, practical manner. Teaching someone how to change a flat tyre is a popular working example. Demonstrating something in action is far more powerful than merely outlining the steps.

## Discussion (50% Retention) – 
This is also known as cooperative learning at times. In order to actively interact with a subject, a bigger group is divided into smaller groups. One might reflect on their own comprehension of the material by hearing how others interpret what they have learned. Their ability to think critically and retain information is enhanced by this.

## Practice Doing (75% Retention) – 
Another term for this would be "hands on" experience. Because it enables one to put their information into practice, it is regarded as one of the best learning strategies. Long-term memory retention is aided by practical application, which also fosters deeper critical thinking and knowledge understanding and, ultimately, increases learning retention. Using the flat tyre as an example once more, practicing changing a tyre yourself is even more beneficial than watching a demonstration of the procedure in terms of knowledge retention.

## Teach Others (90% Retention) – 
According to The Learning Pyramid, this is the approach that promotes learning retention the most. An individual must have a solid grasp of the ideas and specifics around a subject and be able to recall it with ease in order to impart information to others. Additionally, it is believed that interacting with students and answering their inquiries strengthens their capacity for critical thought as well as their memory of the material.
