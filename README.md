# Scientific Method Research
The Scientific Method that I am using is the Learning Pyramid, which consists of 7 components. They are listed below in ascending order of retention of information and have been explained as well.

## Make an observation or ask a question
To find out whether the Learning Pyramid is effective as a learning technique, to learn CMS.

## Gather background information
## Lecture (5% Retention) – 
Although the retention is the least, this is the most common way to teach students. This medium is also the most passive as there is no active participation from the students.

## Reading (10% Retention) – 
Reading is thought to be a somewhat more successful learning method than other methods, even though it is still passive, because it allows students to mark important learning parts and frequently come back to the content as a reference.

## Audio-visual (20% Retention) – 
This kind of learning is becoming more and more popular as digital technology and learning expand. It is thought to be more effective since it includes additional learning components, even though it is still classified as passive learning. Even though visual aids like pictures, handouts, flipcharts, slide shows, projections, and videos are thought to improve learning retention, lectures still take place most of the time.

## Demonstration (30% Retention) – 
According to The Learning Pyramid, demonstration is the first active learning strategy. Put simply, it refers to a teacher demonstrating something to a pupil in a step-by-step, practical manner. Teaching someone how to change a flat tyre is a popular working example. Demonstrating something in action is far more powerful than merely outlining the steps.

## Discussion (50% Retention) – 
This is also known as cooperative learning at times. In order to actively interact with a subject, a bigger group is divided into smaller groups. One might reflect on their own comprehension of the material by hearing how others interpret what they have learned. Their ability to think critically and retain information is enhanced by this.

## Practice Doing (75% Retention) – 
Another term for this would be "hands on" experience. Because it enables one to put their information into practice, it is regarded as one of the best learning strategies. Long-term memory retention is aided by practical application, which also fosters deeper critical thinking and knowledge understanding and, ultimately, increases learning retention. Using the flat tyre as an example once more, practicing changing a tyre yourself is even more beneficial than watching a demonstration of the procedure in terms of knowledge retention.

## Teach Others (90% Retention) – 
According to The Learning Pyramid, this is the approach that promotes learning retention the most. An individual must have a solid grasp of the ideas and specifics around a subject and be able to recall it with ease in order to impart information to others. Additionally, it is believed that interacting with students and answering their inquiries strengthens their capacity for critical thought as well as their memory of the material.


## Create a hypothesis
The Learning Pyramid method is highly effective when one wants to learn something new and retain the information for a long time.

## Create a prediction and perform a test
If I listen in class, I am using the Lecture part of the Learning Pyramid and am only able to remember 5% of the information shared by the professor taking the lesson. 

### Prediction: 
If I pay attention in class, watch the YouTube videos that the professor shows in class, and discuss my learnings with my peers, I can guarantee a good grade in the subject (Distinction and above). 

### Perform a test: 
At the start of the module, I was only using the "Lecture" part of the Learning Pyramid method. 
But, from Week 3 or so, I started paying full attention in class, meticulously noting down the YouTube video links and also discussing what I learnt with my peers. This enabled me to better understand the softwares the professor taught about in greater detail which in turn helped in me getting good grades for the Practicals and Other Assessments.

## Analyze the results and draw a conclusion
### Analysis of Results:
The results were high marks in the CMS Assessments because I had made use of 3 different levels out of the 7 levels of the Learning Pyramid.

### Conclusion:
What I can conclude from this scientific research is that by using the following 3 methods of the Learning Pyramid together, one can learn concepts effectively. Lecture is important to get an overview of the topic, Audio-visual is essential to obtain a deeper understanding or retention because of the use of images, slideshows, flipcharts etc. and lastly Discussion enables us to critically think about the topic and understand each others' opinions.

# Learning Activities & Resources
This week we mainly worked on the group project which was to rebuild the JCU Open House Website to attract more visitors to the site and thus increase the student intake as well. We worked in teams to develop our own theme, used various different software like XAMPP and Vagrant and also worked on the Presentation and the Group Report. Many things were very new to us all such as Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV) and PHP Language. Although it took us some time to get accustomed to the new software, we watched a couple of YouTube videos and used online tutorials to guide us through.

# Estimated Hours 
I spent around 3 days on this week's practical - Individual and Group combined.

# Content Insights 
We faced a lot of problem with installing vagrant but after much trial and error on terminal, we managed to set it up for the group project. It was fun learning through the YouTube videos and something I was glad about was that we also had the liberty to work with our team members, making things slightly easier to understand. Overall, we learnt a lot in the PHP Language. Since we did the entire project through PHP, we improved the way we wrote our code structures, naming, the code logic and also our debugging skills.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week's tasks prepared us a lot for work as there was a lot to be done in a very short period of time. We learnt a lot of new concepts especially new software for the completion of the practical this week. There was a huge time crunch as is the case in most jobs in the IT industry but we somehow pulled through by relying on each other's strengths and picking up new things quickly. I feel skills such as working well under pressure, collaborating within a team and perseverence are crucial skills that are much sought after in the IT industry. Overall, this subject has taught me a lot of valuable skillsets that can be directly transferred to the future IT role that I aspire to do.
